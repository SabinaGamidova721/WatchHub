The planet is also home to a local population of Na’vi humanoids, who greatly respect the surrounding nature. True, the local aborigines greatly interfere with the extraction of the mineral, and on top of everything else, their settlement is located on the largest deposits of unobtanium. In order to find a common language with the Na'vi, the corporation sponsors a program to develop avatars - artificially created humanoid bodies controlled by people based on whose DNA they were created. These people are called operators. Control occurs by transferring a person’s consciousness into the avatar’s body. One of these operators is Marine Jake Sully, who became disabled as a result of injury. In fact, he simply became a replacement for the genius’s deceased brother, because their DNA is the same. Going to Pandora, Jack could not even imagine what an important mission lay ahead of him.
